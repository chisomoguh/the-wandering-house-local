            Comprised of 49 embroidered sentences, the Northfield Community Quilt is one of several works coming out of The Wandering House,
              a multi-platform project by Chilean-American filmmaker and artist, Cecilia Cornejo Sotelo. Featuring an ice-fishing house retrofitted 
              as a mobile audio recording studio, The Wandering House examines notions of home from the perspective of rural and semi-rural towns in 
              southern Minnesota.

              Click on any piece of this interactive version  of the Northfield Community Quilt and you will be able to listen to the sentence recorded anonymously in 2019 and read a short statement by the person who, a year later, embroidered it. The Lanesboro Community Quilt is 
              currently in the works and will be exhibited at Lanesboro Arts in early 2022. Its interactive counterpart is also upcoming, so stay tuned!

                In the summer and fall of 2019, Cecilia invited community members in Northfield and Lanesboro, Minnesota, to enter The Wandering House to record 
                their thoughts on home in a physical space created solely for this purpose. Ranging in age from two to ninety-one years old, project participants 
                included farmers, youths in high school and college, people with disabilities, immigrants from Central and South America, families with young children, 
                and older adults living in retirement communities.

              In the fall of 2020, Cecilia invited Northfield and Lanesboro residents to embroider a selection of fragments
              from the audio collected a year before. All these fragments came from audio snippets responding to the
              prompt “I know I’m home when...” and reflected a wide range of sentiments. From September to December
              2020, over 80 participants from both towns met periodically over Zoom to exchange embroidering tips,
              design ideas, and to enjoy each other’s company. Since then, the embroidered fragments have been assembled
              into two community quilts, one for each town, that function as repositories of the testimonies recorded and a
              testament to creativity and collaboration under pandemic.

              The Northfield Community Quilt was developed by Cecilia Cornejo Sotelo in collaboration with Northfield
              residents. The final piece was assembled and quilted by Northfield fiber artist Cindy Starkey Robinson. This
              interactive version of the Northfield Community Quilt was developed in partnership with students Valentina
              Guerrero Chala and Chisom Oguh, thanks to a grant from the Humanities Center at Carleton College.
